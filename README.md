Dijkstra Visualizer

This project is hosted at https://james-crowley-dijkstra-visualizer.netlify.app/

I built this project in order to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm, an algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph with edges and vertices. This algorithm is used often in the real world, for example in Google Maps to find directions between a starting point and a destination.
